# Looping

A loop is a collection of repeating code. Loops are 
an essential part of most programming languages. And 
with good reason - we often need to complete a task 
more than one time. Sometimes, we need to complete
a task an _indefinite_ number of times. Any time we 
have to repeatedly run the same code, a loop is a
good candidate to consider using.

In this section are lessons and labs on looping and
some of the common looping syntax we see in Ruby.
Topics inclue:

* Looping basics
* Using `times`
* Using `while` and `until` loops
* Using `for` loops

It is recommended that you complete all the lessons in the Prework 
section **Programming as Conversation Part 2: Statements** In addition, 
here are some resources you may find helpful:
